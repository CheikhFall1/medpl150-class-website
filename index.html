    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>
        I am interested in how media shapes perception and influences how people
        understand the world. My creative interests include visual storytelling,
        digital media, and exploring how images affect meaning and identity.
        Through this class, I hope to better understand how media both reflects
        and shapes culture.

    <h2>Course Work</h2>
    <p>
        This website will document my reflections and creative projects
        throughout the semester.
