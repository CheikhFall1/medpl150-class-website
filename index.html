    <h2>Creative Statement</h2>
    <p>
        I am interested in learning about different ways to creatively express myself in any form of media. 
        My creative interests includes photography and 
        digital media, and exploring how images affect meaning.
        Through this class, I hope to better understand how media both reflects
        and shapes culture.

    <p>
        This website will document my reflections and creative projects
        throughout the semester.
